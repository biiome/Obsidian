## Agenda
1. [[Questions]]

## Minutes
- **Problem:** A way to determine if a cannula is infusing into the vein on into the tissue.
- Can produce ECG through placement of cannula in vein and ECG tag on chest.
- Current gold standard way monitoring patient status during TIVA is through 3 lead EEG.
-  

## Questions Raised During Meeting
- **Is propofol electrically conductive?**
	- Need to test.
	- How is it mixed with the extension set 

- **Why doesn't pump occlude outside of vein?**
	- It does, just the compliance of the skin means that the pressure alarm is only triggered way later. Patient may regain motor control by the time the tissuing is noticed. See [[Questions]].

- **Does the ECG waveform change when you stop infusing the NaCl solution?**

## Agenda
1. Determine if tissuing can be detected as a change in impedance when using 2 experimental setups:
	1. 2 electrodes - Cannula and ECG dot
	2. 2 electrodes - Cannula and skin piercing electrode
