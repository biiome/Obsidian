## Peripheral Intravenous Cannula (PIVC)
- Used for direct infusion of fluids into the blood stream.
- Often left in the patient for long amounts of time.

- When a PIVC is inserted, a flashback of blood in the chamber confirms it's in the vein.
- Afterwards, the ==cannula location is estimated by the flow of IV fluids== (either by infusion pump or gravity)
- PIVCs aften become blocked, kinked or dislodged and need to be checked with each infusion.
- PIVC function can be assessed with two simple questions:
	1. Does the IV flush easily?
	2. Does the IV fluid flow easily?
- Resistance or failure to flush or flow indicated that the PIVC might be kined or blocked, or ==or could have migrated out of the vessel==

More of the current must pass between the cells as the current decreases. This is the main mechanism behind the Î²-dispersion (fig. 2) and is an example of frequency dependent properties of tissue.
