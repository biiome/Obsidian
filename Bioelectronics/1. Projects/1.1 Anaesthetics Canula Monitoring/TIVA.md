# Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA)

#note

---

## What Is TIVA?
- Maintenance of general anaesthesia by intravenous (i.v.) infusion

## When Is It Used?
- Not the preferred method of sedation, but still used often in a host of situations:
	- Anaesthesia delivered outside the operating room - during patient transfer
	- Operations of the airway
	- Situation with inhalation anaesthesia is contraindicated

## How Is It Performed?
- Anaesthesia induced and maintained by infusion of anaesthetic agent (usually propofol) into the venous system.
- Drug is infused into the patient to achieve and maintain an appropriate concentration in the patient's plasma and brain.
	- This requires varying infusion rates, generally a bolus (rapid infusion) followed by a decreasing infusion rate.
- Required infusion rate is determined by pharmacokinetic models.
	- Models base infusion rates based on patient's characteristics - age, body weight, height etc.
- Currently, no evidence supports the use of one propofol TCI model over another and all have proved reliable in clinical practice.


## Monitoring TIVA
- At present, propofol plasma concentrations cannot be measured minute-to-minute in a practicable manner.
- Depth of anaesthesia usually measured using EEG.
-  NICE has recommended deployment of a processed EEG device when administering TIVA and NAP5 emphasized that this is particularly necessary in patients who require neuromuscular paralysis.
