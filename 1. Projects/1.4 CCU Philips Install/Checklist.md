## To-Do
- [x] Check with #Alvin if we have enough licenses for 10 new monitors
	- 12-Lead licenses are already assigned to all planned beds in CCU
- [x] Ask #Suresh_K to get me the current monitor configuration
- [x] Request quote for 10 new monitors + bid-side installation
	- Request quote for MX850, MX750 and any other similar option which incudes a battery reserve
	- [x] Can we even get MX800s anymore? Or do we have to get MX850s?
		- Nope, confirmed that MX800 model is obsolete
	- Make sure quote is for the same configuration as currently available
- #Alvin to raise the following EMPACS:
	- [x] Cabling from CCU to G42 comms room for addition of 2 comms ports to each bedside
	- [x] UPS port at each bedside
	- [ ] Upgrade CCU to cardiac protected area (CF)
- [x] Determine if there is sufficient room for expansion with the current hardware in the comms room
	- 3x ports available on AX1 (G42 switch)
	- 8x ports available on AX2 (G41 switch)
	- 12x ports available on AX3 (G43 switch)
		- Spread 10 new ports between AX2 and AX3. This means that 2 monitors on the AX3 switch are susceptible to switch failure as AX3 does not have a hot spare
- [x] Get pictures of X2 configuration and MX800 back for Philips
- [x] Inform Philips about current licensing situation
