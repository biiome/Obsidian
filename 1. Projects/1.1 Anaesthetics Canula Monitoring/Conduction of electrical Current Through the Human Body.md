## Skin Resistance
- The body has resistance to current flow.
- More than 99% of the body's resistance to electric current flow is at the skin. A dry hand may have a resistance of more than 100,000Ω
- The internal body resistance is about 300Ω, being related to the wet, relatively salty tissues beneath the skin 
- Skin resistance is bypassed if there is a break in the skin (cut, abrasion, etc.) or through immersion in water
- Skin acts like a capacitor in that it allows more current to flow if a voltage is changing rapidly
	- Does this mean the skin has a lower resistance to AC current

## AC vs DC
- Membranes of excitable tissue will pass current into cells most effectively with AC current
- Cardiac muscle cells will receive 60 stimulations per second, if the amplitude of the current is sufficient, ventricular fibrillation will occur.
