- **Long term or short term monitoring?**
	- Monitoring during the course of the surgery

- **Why not just use the occlusion warnings from the infusion pump?**
	- Occlusion warning occurs too late, might be 10-30 minutes after the needle has tissued. By the point that the pump alarms, the patient may start regaining motor function

- **Why cannulation for anesthesia?**
	- TIVA is becoming more and more the preferred option for anaesthesia.
		- Some practical benefits + environmental benefits

- **What situations would this be used in?**
	- Most/all situations using TIVA - TIVA is used quite commonly (up to 1/3 of all surgeries)

- **Can you use other tools in this situation?**
	- No other cannulation monitors OR infusion monitoring devices are currently on the market

- **Can we dilute propofol with NaCl during a procedure?**
